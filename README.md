GrowControlBox
==============

Open Source repo for a Raspberry Pi controlled Grow Room



GrowControlBox, aka GCB, is a Raspberry Pi, Python, powered system, to offer modular control and interfacing to all aspects of an indoor garden. Modular is the main key here. The code will be written in a way that anyone can make the few changes they need, no coding knowledge needed, and to allow the end user to build as simple or as complex of a system that best suits their needs.

This code is in NO WAY finished, and will be added to, refined, and re-written over the next few years.
