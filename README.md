GrowControlBox
==============

Open Source repo for a Raspberry Pi controlled Grow Room



GrowControlBox, aka GCB, is a Raspberry Pi, Python, powered system, to offer modular control and interfacing to all aspects of an indoor garden. Modular is the main key here. The code will be written in a way that anyone can make the few changes they need, no coding knowledge needed, and to allow the end user to build as simple or as complex of a system that best suits their needs.

This code is in NO WAY finished, and will be added to, refined, and re-written over the next few years.

First Upload of files!
TempRH.py is where all the action is happening right now. I have started to work on this again.

You will need a relay board, and some DS18B20 temp sensors. I prefer to get the ones already in a stainless steel water proof casing. You will also need WiringPi installed. I might be missing a couple things. :)
